Deregulation: `Conspiracy of Incompetence'
Even if energy prices are being manipulated, it may not be illegal

█████████████, Chronicle Staff Writer 
STATE -- Profit-hungry power companies may be manipulating ██████████'s 
electricity prices, industry insiders say, but the attorney general will have 
a tough time finding a smoking gun in ███ price-fixing probe. Even if ██ does 
prove that electricity generators are ``gaming'' the market with a variety of 
price-influencing techniques, it's a whole other matter as to whether their 
actions violate the law. 
State legislators will attempt to shed some light on this murky matter during 
hearings █████ in ██████████. 
What they will quickly discover is that power companies are having a field 
day as ██████████ muddles through deregulation of its electricity market. 
Among other things, power generators are said to be rigging electricity 
auctions and holding back juice until higher demand drives up wholesale 
prices, representing perhaps the single most glaring example of gaming, or 
price-fixing, the market. 
However, the generators aren't the only ones to blame for the current mess. 
``This has literally been a conspiracy of incompetence,'' said █████████Shames, executive director of █████████████████████████████████████, a ███ 
█████ grass- roots organization. ``Almost every player has made major 
mistakes or a series of mistakes.'' 
Utilities, ██ said, are also to blame for whopping price increases by 
mishandling power purchases. Meanwhile, state and federal regulators have 
demonstrated a virtually unwavering reluctance to weigh in and help stabilize 
electricity rates. 
At the same time, legislators themselves share some of the blame for 
██████████'s energy woes by drafting rules for the deregulated market that 
are too easily bent, if not broken. 
``All the market participants are taking advantage of very lax rules,'' said 
█████████████, president of ██████████████ Public Utilities Commission. ``The 
market is not competitive.'' 
As a stopgap, Gov. ████ █████ █████████ called on the ███ to cut ███ █████ 
electricity prices in half over ██████████████████, although ██ was vague on 
how this can be accomplished. 
████ DEREGULATION 
When electricity deregulation was approved in ████, the goal was to lower 
prices by boosting competition. 
In practice, however, only about a half-dozen power generators are now 
responsible for as much as three-quarters of the state's energy supply, and 
they can set prices pretty much as they see fit. 
Officials at ██████████████ ██████████████, the wholesale market where power 
companies sell their juice and utilities go shopping, insist that they 
closely monitor all transactions. 
But they admit that it is impossible to know what may transpire among 
generators off the trading floor. 
``There are hundreds of ways that somebody could do it,'' exchange spokesman 
███████████████ said of whether price-fixing is possible. ``You could argue 
that it happens █████████. 
``But I don't see how you could call this gaming,'' ██ said. ``You call it 
business.'' 
There's the rub. Although residents of ███ █████, the first ██████████ city 
to feel the full effects of deregulation, have seen average power bills more 
than double over █████████████████████, power generators say this is simply a 
result of supply and demand. 
SUPPLY LIMITED, DEMAND RISING 
With supply severely limited -- no major power plants have been built in the 
state in ████████ -- and demand rapidly rising, it is only natural, they say, 
that electricity prices would go through the roof. 
``It's a feast-or-famine business,'' said █████████████, executive director 
of ████████████ ███████████████████████████, an energy industry group. ``You 
make a lot of money when times are good, and lose a lot of money when times 
are bad.'' 
At the moment, times are very good for power generators. An unusually hot 
██████ has combined with a booming, tech-fueled economy to push ██████████'s 
power grid nearly to the breaking point on an almost █████ basis. 
The question is: Are power companies benefiting from what are, for them, 
lucky circumstances, or are they making a bad situation even worse with 
practices that may not be illegal but still could be viewed as highly 
irresponsible? 
FOUR WHOLESALE MARKETS 
There are four major wholesale markets for electricity in ██████████. The 
biggest is called the █████ forward market, where generators and utilities 
meet each morning to buy and sell power on an hour-by-hour basis covering the 
next 24 hours. 
Electricity at times of expected low demand, such as 1 a.m., might go for as 
little as $25 per megawatt, while electricity during peak demand -- 3 p.m. to 
7 p.m. -- often sells for the maximum allowable amount, or $250 per megawatt. 
Longer-term contracts are negotiated on what is called the block forward 
market, where prices are more stable. 
But, industry sources say, power companies are increasingly focusing more on 
the hourly and real-time markets, where the potential for profit is greater 
than on the █████ forward market because buyers have less room to maneuver -- 
they have to meet immediate demand. 
``Of course people are gaming the market,'' said ███████████, senior vice 
president of ███████████ and ████████████ ``They know when to make bids and 
how to get what they want. Is that illegal? I honestly don't know.'' 
████████████, who oversees the real-time wholesale market on behalf of the 
██████████ Independent System Operator, agreed that the legality of such 
moves has yet to be determined. 
``The power marketers know our rules,'' ██ said, ``and they use them to their 
benefit.'' 
Even so, ██████████████ officials said they will tell legislators █████ that 
their own study of wholesale electricity prices shows that ██████████ rates 
in █████████████ were in fact lower than in other states. 
``This makes it harder to make a case that market power is being exerted by 
power generators,'' said the exchange's █████████. ``It's exceedingly 
difficult to prove that there's market power.'' 
NO HEDGING IN SAN DIEGO 
Meanwhile, ███ █████ Gas & Electric has been accused of adding to electricity 
price volatility in the Southern ██████████ city by not securing long-term 
contracts for energy at a steady rate -- a process known as ``hedging.'' 
Instead, the utility exposed its customers to █████ price spikes, which 
resulted in power bills surging skyward. 
``███ █████ is bearing the brunt (of deregulation) for a couple of reasons: 
poor hedging and poor hedging,'' █████████ said. 
For its part, ████ has said it learned its lesson from ███ █████ and will 
make active use of hedging when its customers face the impact of 
deregulation, perhaps as soon as next ██████. 
█████ called █████████ for Attorney General ████████████ to investigate 
``possible manipulation'' in the wholesale electricity market. ██ also has 
asked federal regulators to rule that ██████████'s energy market is not 
competitive and to mandate ``just and reasonable'' rates. 
But regulators at both the federal and state levels so far have been 
reluctant to act, preferring instead to allow deregulation to run its course. 
For all these reasons, ██████████'s energy market has been especially 
vulnerable to exploitation by those who may not have consumers' best 
interests at heart. 
``The system of responsibility is fragmented,'' the ███'s Lynch said, ``and 
because it is fragmented, it allows various players to game the market.'' 
WHAT CAN BE DONE 
The solution? It depends who you ask. Most of those on the energy playing 
field believe that some degree of regulation is necessary to stabilize 
electricity prices, but no one yet knows how far legislators should go in 
drafting revised rules. 
Increased generating capacity will go a long way toward solving ██████████'s 
problems, but it will be █████ before enough new plants come online to bring 
supply and demand into balance. 
█████'s hearings in ██████████ will presumably lay the groundwork for future 
initiatives. Although few if anyone knows how to fix things, everyone at 
least agrees that something -- anything -- needs to be done. 
``Government messes things up a lot of times, and the private sector messes 
things up a lot of times,'' said ████'s ███████. ``But in the end, solutions 
emerge because it's just too important. That's the case now.''

Gov. █████ Calls for Cut in Electricity Bills
███ under no obligation to heed unclear request 
█████████████, ██████████████, ██████████, Chronicle Staff Writers

U99453.DTL&type=business 
Gov. ████ █████ █████████ called on ██████████████ Public Utilities 
Commission to cut soaring ███ █████ electricity bills in half during the next 
two █████. 
However, it was not clear how ██ expects the ███ to accomplish this goal or 
whether the commission will even heed the governor's request. █████ does not 
have the authority to order the ███ to act. 
``This is not a rate freeze,'' █████ told reporters in ██████████. ``It is a 
rate-stabilization plan.'' 
It appears that what ██ has in mind is having ███ █████ Gas & Electric, the 
local utility, level out power bills by spreading its wholesale costs over 
longer periods. This would reduce customers' bills in the ██████ but raise 
bills at other times of ████████. 
``This is an oraclelike document,'' ██████████████, executive director of ███ 
█████'s Utility Consumers' Action Network, said after reading a press release 
outlining the governor's position. ``You can read almost anything into it.'' 
Calling electricity prices in ███ █████ exorbitant, █████ said ██ wants the 
███ to reduce average residential power bills from the current level of about 
$120 a month to approximately $65. 
``Electricity is the pulse of our economy,'' ██ said. ``Without it, consumers 
and businesses are put at risk. ██████████ simply cannot afford any more 
price spikes or blackouts.'' 
█████████, a █████ appointee on the ███, said ██ believes the governor is 
seeking a so-called level pricing program for SDG&E customers. The ███ is 
empowered to order the utility to implement such a program. 
The utility itself already is urging ratepayers to adopt a similar pricing 
plan, thereby paying consistent electricity fees throughout ████████. 
``We can't make the prices go away, but we can set up a system where the 
prices are level and deferred,'' ████ said. 
███ President █████████████ said ███ will call a special meeting of the 
commission for █████████ to discuss the governor's proposal. 
█████' comments came ahead of a joint hearing █████ at 10 a.m. on 
██████████'s energy woes by the ██████ and ████████ utilities committees in 
████████████████████. 
Also █████, state Sen. ███████████, ██████████ (███ █████ County), and 
████████woman ███████████, ████████████, are expected to introduce identical 
bills seeking to roll back electricity rates in ███ █████ to prederegulation 
levels. 
``We appreciate what the governor has done, but we feel there needs to be a 
parallel track in ███████████████ where we find a solution for ███ █████ 
ratepayers,'' ██████ said. 
The governor said ██ will contact President ███████ and █████████████, 
chairman of ████████████████████████████████████████, to urge them to 
expedite an investigation of ██████████'s wholesale electricity market. 
██ also has called on Attorney General ████████████ to probe suspected price 
fixing by power generators. 
``I believe in making a profit,'' █████ said. ``I believe in success. But 
charging seven, eight, nine times the price you pay for electricity is simply 
unconscionable. It's not fair to ██████████. It will bring down our economy, 
and it augers very poorly for ███████.'' 
Meanwhile, █████████████ said it may sail to the rescue in ███ █████ by 
bringing in its own electricity- generating equipment to keep its extensive 
bases in the area humming. 
The ████ is SDG&E's single biggest customer, drawing about 3 percent of the 
utility's total output. 
The ████ said in a statement that it is looking into transporting 10 
750-kilowatt generators from its facility in ████████████ to ███ █████. 
For its part, ██████████████ Grocers Association said its members will reduce 
electricity usage by 10 percent during periods of unusually heavy demand. 
This could include lowering store lighting and cutting air conditioning at 
some supermarkets. 
``Although consumers may notice some differences while in their local 
supermarket, the energy-saving measures will not affect normal store 
operations,'' said ████████████, president of the association. ``Also, none 
of these measures will have a negative impact on food safety or quality.''
