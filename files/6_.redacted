TSWG Meeting notes for 8/23/00

Midway, ██████, ██, ███████, ████, & more.

Settlement Dispute System (███):

Not implemented yet.

Automated Dispatch System (ADS):

The ADS Query File Data Dictionary was released █████████. ADS client 26 was
released 8/23. Features include Query data which now contain decimals
instead of integer values and system performance improvement by limiting
queries to ██████ worth of data at a time. A question was raised about what
time standard is used for instructions. █████████ responded it is ███████.

RMR Scheduling:

No comments

10-Minute Settlement:

The ███ parser had corrections made. ███████████ price fix (looking for 6
values instead of 1) has been implemented and is working. Also the
supplemental energy import parsing order was corrected. The █████████████
template does successfully parse through the existing parser. ██████████████
is working with ███ to correct the localized parser problem. The question
was raised if there may be only one record supporting two charge types. CP
responded that for CTs 401/407 there is, and can be, one record supporting
multiple charge types. A question was raised concerning instructions being
over lapped to ████████████. ████ responded that there are no instructions
that are issued to ███████████████. ████ also reminded everyone that
effective ████████ that the ███ stated using ramping energy versus block
energy for dispatches. ██ also reminded all that residual energy would be in
effect on █████████████.  The ██ asked if there were ██ loss calculation
available for the market simulation information. CP stated that there was
and would forward it on to the ██. It is also planned to publish the
implementation schedule ████████████████.

InterSC █████████████████████████:

The implementation target date for █████████████████████████████ has been
delayed until █████████████████████████████████. A new schedule has been
published. A training class has been tentatively scheduled for ██████████████ . Details to follow.

OASIS Redesign:

███████████ explained that the project is progressing satisfactorily. ██ is
still anticipating a market testing in ████████████ with full implementation
in ████████████. A concerned was raised about the amount of time, if any was
being allotted for overlapping of templates.

Dual Invoicing:

Everyone was reminded that the first preliminary invoices were coming out
8/24.

Other:

A request was made (after the TSWG call) to change the time of the call to
1330 PDT to accommodate those in the ████████████ zone.  Comments are
requested.
