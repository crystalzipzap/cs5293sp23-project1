MARKET NOTICE---EMERGENCY OPERATING ORDER RELATING TO UNINSTRUCTED
DEVIATIONS █████████████

This notice is to advise all Scheduling Coordinators and owners of
Generation in the ███ Control Area that the ███ is issuing an operating
order for █████████████, that all resources must follow final Hour Ahead
Schedules, as adjusted by ████████████████████, or by ████████ instructions
verbal or electronic, on ████████████████████████████████████████ bids.  NO
UNINSTRUCTED DEVIATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED.  Section 2.3.1.2.1 of the ███
Tariff requires Market Participants in the ███ Control Area to "comply fully
and promptly with the ███'s operating orders." Any Generating Unit with real
time output that reflects an excessive deviation from the real time output
consistent with its Final Hour Ahead Schedule as adjusted by ████████
instructions, and assuming a 20 minute ramp across the top of the hour for
hourly Schedule changes, will be deemed to have failed to comply with this
operating order.  For the purpose of this determination, an excessive
deviation shall be the smaller of 10% of a Generating Unit's maximum
capability, or 10 MW.  The only exception to this finding is a ███████████████ that provides the ███ with timely notification of a unit outage or
derate. Failure to comply with this operating order threatens the reliable
operation of the ███ Control Area.  In particular, uninstructed incremental
deviations by ████████████████ that are "chasing" the BEEP Interval Prices
published by the ███ are directly responsible for the frequency excursions
the ███ experienced  June 13, ████. The ███ will take the following actions
with respect to those ████████████████ that fail to comply with this
Operating Order: 1) ███ Management will deliver a report to the ███
Governing Board that provides a copy of this notice, and a comparison of the
instructed and actual output profile for ████████████████████ that fails to
comply. 2) The ███ will assign any WSCC RMS penalties associated with
frequency deviations to the ████████████████ that fail to comply.
