███:

I cannot make this stuff up.  ███████████, the Senator famous for ███
fight to protect ██████████████████████████, came to fame as the writer
of the Critically aclaimed film, Attack of the Killer ██████es.  I
didn't believe it either until someone sent me this web page, with ███
link attached to it.

This page is dedicated to the three demented geniuses who brought us the 
Killer ██████es films!

███████████████████████/Writer

████████████ was the director of all four Killer ██████es films. ██ also 
played small roles in each film, even playing ███████ in a few! ██ still runs 
many parts of ███████████████████████, I'm told.

███████████ - Writer/Actor

███████████ is probably best known in the ██ films as ██████, the dim-witted, 
parachute-wearing leader of the Killer ██████es Task force. ██ also wrote 
parts of the films as well. Now, ██'s a state Senator, and even has ███ own 
page at http://www.stevepeace.net

?

████████████ - Writer

Last, but definitley not least is ████████████. ██'s responsible for the 
entire concept of Killer ██████es! Like everyone else here, ██ played small 
parts throughout the films. Probably ███ best known was the kid in the 
library in the original film, who cleared out the room by merely saying 
"██████!". This little part was later used as a major character in the 
cartoon series.
