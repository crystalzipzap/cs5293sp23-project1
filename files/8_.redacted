███,
It has been a valiant effort but as soon as we free up space on the Notes 
server it fills back in. 
So as a result we will be shutting down the notes server tonight from 8:00 PM 
until 12:00 AM to rebuild the data drives. This will provide more space to 
work with and allow for room to grow.
We will also be turning on a purge agent in ███████ that will eliminate mail 
from your █████, Sent Mail and █████ after it reaches ██████████████.
Please shut down Lotus Notes before you leave to night to help ensure we do 
not lose any data.

Thanks,
███████.
