As you may have noticed, there was a network error during █████'s ██████ with 
Dr. █████████.  Although the questions and answers were not visible during 
the second half of the ██████ session, Dr. █████ did answer all the questions 
██ received.  As always, the transcript of the discussion will be available 
in ███████████████████.  

If the technical issue prevented you from asking a question during █████'s 
session, please email your question to █████████ at █████ Energy Services.  
Dr. █████ has generously offered to respond to questions that could not be 
submitted during the live event.
