Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The ███ has posted the ████ subpoena on its website at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf>   As stated
in a message forwarded █████████ to market participants and scheduling
coordinators, the ████ has agreed to extend the deadline for a reply to
██████████████, although the ███ has been informed █████ that the extension
is only until NOON on ██████.  In addition, the ███ discussed the reference
to an affidavit in the subpoena with the ████ and was informed that this
results from a typo which will be corrected in a corrected document sent by
federal express to the ███ █████████ (the words attached affidavit will be
replaced with the word attachments).  The ███ has accepted federal express
service of the subpoena.

The ███ has raised confidentiality concerns with the ████ and the ████
agreed to circulate a draft of a confidentiality agreement to the ███ █████.
The ███ will forward the draft to market participants and scheduling
coordinators as soon as we receive it.  Once again the ███ reiterates to
market participants that to the extent they have outstanding issues as to
the subpoena, these should be raised directly with the appropriate entity.
The ███ intends to comply with the subpoena on ██████ unless it receives a
legally sufficient communication to the contrary from the ████ or a court.

Finally, a few market participants have requested that the ███ make
available several letters forwarded to the ███ discussing confidential
treatment.  These letters are attached.

Questions should be directed to █████████████, at 916-608-7144.

█████████████,
Regulatory Counsel
