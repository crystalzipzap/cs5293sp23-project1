17:25 GMT 8 August ████ =DJ Power Price Cap In █████ Puts Brinksmanship On
Grid

   By ███████████
   Of ███████████████████

████████ (Dow Jones)--█████ornia's new, lower cap on the price of wholesale
power is intended to bring relief to consumers burned by this ██████'s
high-flying electricity rates.
But it has also set the stage for a game of chicken between utilities and
power producers - with the operator of the state's power grid caught in the
middle and a major blackout the consequence if both sides hold their course
on █████████.
By creating incentives for power producers and power buyers to wait on the
sidelines, the price cap has put █████████ornia Independent System Operator
in the position of covering much of the state's power demand at the last
minute - something the grid operator was never intended to do.
"It's not designed to handle a third of the load, and it's not designed to
be the arbitrage tool for either those buying electricity or those supplying
it," Jan ████████████, chairman of ███████'s board of governors, said of the
███'s real-time power market. "For ███████ to find 15,000 ██ of power on any
given day is a huge undertaking that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on
the real-time operation of the grid. We're going to be in trouble."
Thanks to a break in this ██████'s high temperatures in █████ornia, ███████
managed to find the power it needed ██████ and bought it under the new price
cap of $250 a megawatt-hour. It also looks to be able to make it through
███████.
But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for █████████
and ████████ - or whenever the next heat wave comes.
The state's power grid is run by ███████, established by the state's
legislature to ensure that █████ornia's utilities were getting enough power
to meet their customer needs.
█████████ typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance based
on weather forecasts and system capacity. A different state-chartered
organization, █████████ornia Power Exchange buys most of the power the
utilities need █████████████ of time.
The ███ is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts of
power on a last-minute basis as necessary.
But the price cap is changing the way the game is played.
Prices in ███████'s real-time market are capped at $250 a megawatt-hour. But
prices in █████████'s day-ahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket.
As a result, █████ornia's main utilities - ██████████ (███) unit ██████████████████████, ████████████████████ (EIX) unit Southern █████ornia Edison and
█████████████ (███) unit ████████████████████████ - will buy only those
supplies available on the day-ahead market that are bid at ███████ cap or
less.
That policy makes sense - electricity is widely regarded as the most
volatile commodity in existence, prices can rise 100-fold in a matter of
days and █████ornia's prices are about four times their level last ██████.
But it isn't the most sustainable.
Grid Operator Left To Cover Large Shortfall
On ██████, for example, █████████ornia PX reported that the utilities bought
all the power suppliers bid in below the price cap, a total of 27,500
megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours.
But as the sun rose over █████████ornia sky and air conditioners ramped up,
the three utilities needed 40,000 megawatts of power to meet demand -
leaving ███████ not just to tweak the system, but to buy almost a third of
what was required.
"It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system," ███
spokesman ████████████████ said.
On ██████, ███████ had to leave its official, computer-based market and
scramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities by
telephone, as it has done numerous times this ██████.
The question for █████ornia is whether independent generating companies and
utilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or below
the $250 price cap, or whether they'll be able to sell their output for a
higher price elsewhere.
Like much of the rest of the country, the western ████ now needs more
electricity during ██████ afternoons than it can generate. The booming
electricity-driven new economy has been met with almost no additions to
generating capacity. Companies that have generating capacity are looking for
top dollar.
"Our real-time folks' job is to optimize revenue and get the highest price
for that energy that they can," said ████████████, spokesman for ██████████████████████ of ██████████ (███), which regularly sells power to █████ornia.
"There is no preference of customer. There's preference for maximizing the
revenue that hour of that day."
The $250 cap, half what it was until ██████ and a third of what it was until
██████, is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seen
frequently this ██████.
The ███ has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep the
lights on, but doing so could make a shambles of the state's official power
market.
Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have no
incentive to bid in supply on ███████'s computer system at prices under the
cap if they know ███████ will be picking up the phone later with sweeter
deals.
"At 10 a.m. ███████ operators have to run around and find a sufficient
amount of capacity in ████████ to serve our needs, and on █████████ there
really is only a limited amount of capacity to go around," ████████████
said.
"We're going to have figure out a better way of managing this," ██ added.
