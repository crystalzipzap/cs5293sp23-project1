  Market Participants:
  This notice is to inform you that the  ███ is canceling the
CMR stakeholder meetings that were scheduled for █████████████████████.  We
are doing so in order to be responsive to ███████████s' needs for greater
detail as articulated in the two most recent ███████████ meetings on ███████
and 25.
  As you know, after the ██████████ introduction to the CME
Recommendation, we scheduled additional meetings (███████th and 25th, ██████
4th and 8th) to discuss each element of the Recommendation in greater
detail. We have received many questions and requests for change on all parts
of the Recommendation during ██████████████████.  As a result, we determined
that we needed more time for internal discussion in order to give you the
level of detail that would allow a more meaningful discussion of the
specific recommendations and potential modifications.  This will allow us to
address both your questions and your suggested changes.
  We have rescheduled these detailed discussions for ██████████████████████, ██████ 15-17.  In these meetings, we will address:
* ████;
* █████████ and Hour Ahead Congestion Management;
* ███████████████████████;
* ████████████████████;
* ████████████████████████████████████;
* ███████████████████████; and
* Questions and issues on █████████████████████████ that arose from
the July 25 ███████████ meeting.
  We will also meet on ██████ 25 to discuss the ███'s final
recommendation to the ███ Governing Board.
  We apologize for any inconvenience this change has caused
you, but believe that taking time to develop more details on these topics
will allow more productive discussions.
  Byron ██████
  Director, Client Relations
