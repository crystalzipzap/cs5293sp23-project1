███,
Wanted to say hello. My trip to ███████ and ███████
was a blast. Had a good time in both countries. A lot
of history blah, blah, blah. Been with the first
Marines for ███████████████ and I am beginning to
figure my way around. Working out every day and
running (on my own) a great deal. Do not want to be
the wimp of the bunch. Should be fun █████████ with a
lot of training which will culminate with a deployment
to ███████ █████████ sometime and thats it.

Otherwise thing are good for me. I will be heading ████████████████████████████ in ████ to attend a wedding
of my ██ friend ████. You probably remember ███. Will
be home for ██████. First time since I left ████school. Taking my girlfriend with me back home. ███
has already met the Rat in █████. ███ also met ████
and ███ bride to be when they came out here for  a
week in ██████████.

Hope all is well with you. Any little ███s in the
future? Stay in touch and I hope the ███████ can hold
on and the ██████ finally unload the old man. Now,
there is no way they can compete with █████.

Later,
████
