 THE ██████ BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

=0F"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F" ██ asked in an outrage.  My friend, =
Ol=0F'
████ in ███████, has trouble understanding the workings of our power
business here in ██████████.  In fact, so do ████Yesterday=0F's Joint
█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ did nothing to
improve either ████=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment
██████████ is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.

=0F"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing
utilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F" ██ mused between sips
of █████ longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F"Come to think
of it, ████, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F" I recalled,
=0F"Senator Peace was expounding on ███ favorite idea which is forcing the
███ or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build
them.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after ██ suggested to ███
Chairman ████ that ███████ and the ██ should be folded into █████
agencies under the direction of ██████████████████████ Board.=0F"

I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know
██████████ will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out
of ███████=0F's oven ██████████████████.

=0F"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the
███=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator
planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F" ████ added. =0F"So you agree
with ████ (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F" I retorted. =
=0F"Oh,
I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,
and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in ███████████
market went against me,=0F" ████ recalled.  =0F"I called everyone who I tra=
ded
with, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what
will it cost for 50 MW?=0F"

=0F"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F" I wondered.  =0F"I didn=0F't want to=
 show ███ my
position.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for
50, first,=0F" ████ chided.

=0F"What happened?=0F" =0F"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=
=0F'd
take it, and then said I needed another fifty.  ██ asked $300.  I took
that, and ██ priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F" lamented ████.  =0F"██ just
wanted to see how far ██ could push me. ███████'s what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=0F"

=0F"But ████, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of
a generating plant.=0F"

And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a
target for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=
l
wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average
trading price climbs even as the so-called =0F"dysfunctional=0F" price spik=
es
are eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic
principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the
imposition of an additional constraint.

I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda █████████.

 @@@ ███ Issues ███ on ████████████████████████ ████et

>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)

>>> Things in the Mailbag

It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.

███ Energy=0F's ████████████ was only too quick to tell me, =0F"Please Gary=
,
no more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the
year you get ████████ letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really
not know how to spell █████████???  Please let us know what is going on
with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???
Bay!!!!=0F"

It is good to have friends like █████.  They make the pain of separation
so much easier. And █████, when you ███ guys get that ███████ merger
sorted out, in █████████████ or so, you let us know. I want to
participate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about
Fentergy PLus?

Next, from the ██=0F's ██████████, who writes, =0F"As you've heard from
others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material
█████████. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a
sprinkle of irony, tragedy (███ Drama).  Though you are usually neutral
regarding the ██, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I
think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the
industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the ██ to
successfully open this market.=0F"

Thanks, ████.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this
stuff ██████████ is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have
learned from watching ████ (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk
(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of
how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.

███████████████, I received from the ██=0F's █████████████████ a note,
which ███ wants you to know are ███ opinions, not necessarily the ██=0F's.
█████'s okay, ████████.  I paid ██████,█████████, the $20 I owed ███ for
that sham █████████ bet, (remember?, ████████ lost) and your opinions
are cool with us.  =0F"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high
unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are
up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate █████████
consumer who can't afford to keep the ██ on. But what about the inflated
unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over ███████████████████?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from
how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those
who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford
the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the
consumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the
unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side
responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I
can't drive █████ because gas is too expensive=0F'
vs. =0F`I can't turn up the ██ █████ because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F"

Finally, from one of our [secret] ██████████ readers, and I am not
telling who, I received the following: =0F"I ... broke down and listened to
the [███ Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that
the "speak fast" was applied to everyone but ████ Peace.  My goodness,
what a mess we have.  I loved █████'s picture in █████████ -- it spoke
volumes.  My sources at ████ tell me, though, that we should keep an eye
out for {████ Chairman] ███████ to do something really ... [Censored]
... for political reasons.  Given █████████████ meetings █████████████,
the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope ██ can't do
all that much.=0F"

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of ██████████
 @@@ The ███ Replies to ███████ Report

Several of you people commented to me that ███████=0F's reply to the
███/███ report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of
it for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on ███████=0F's
website.

=0F"... the [███/███] Report asserts that the suspected activities of
certain generators on ███████ created frequency instability leading to
████████████ blackouts █████████████████. In fact, the events of ███████
and ███████ were completely independent of one another. The voltage
instability on ███████ was caused by system conditions on ████████ alone
-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific
local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of
generation from outside the area.

=0F"The Report states that ███████ =0F"never tried=0F" to call upon consume=
rs to
reduce demand in order to avoid ████████████ blackouts. In fact, ███████
had in place on ███████ a number of demand response programs designed to
reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response ███████, under
which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail
energy use in exchange for a fee

=0F"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by
=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=
1.2
billion in █████████████████ alone). These assertions leave one with the
mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by
the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the
total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward
contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy
markets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F"lock-in=0F" a specific
price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are
specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and
are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that
some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the
recent price spikes.

=0F"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that ██████████ =0F"might well=
=0F"
have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in
███████ ████. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would
have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of
peak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the
███ competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order
to secure the necessary power, ███████ must purchase, on a bilateral
basis, this energy from resources located outside of ███████=0F's control
area.

=0F"The Report asserts that ██████████ power markets =0F"are not now
competitive=0F" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the
normal state of affairs. It is not. █████████████████████████████████
has noted that =0F"market power in ██████████████ energy market appears to
arise
primarily during periods of peak demand,=0F" and warned that demand growth
would increase the incidence of market power during ██████████████████.

=0F"The Report asserts that ███████ is answerable only to a self-interested
board and not to the citizens of ██████████. This simply is not the
case. The ███ is subject to the provisions of █████████████████████ and
to the rules and regulations of ████, which dictate, in part, that
wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public
interest. The ███ further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and
approved by ████. Every change to our market design and virtually every
aspect of ███████=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by ████.
The ████ process provides substantial opportunities for input by the
state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants
in ████████ proceedings.

=0F"The Report asserts that ██████████ supply conditions have been affected
by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made
██████████ more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is
unfounded. Significant load growth in ██████████ and neighboring states
coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both
generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.
Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and
siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will
this significant shortage be addressed.=0F"

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of ██████████
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of ██████ Hearings

If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve ██████████
legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs
of electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight
Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their
facts.  Then you get a glimpse of what █████████=0F's Joint ██████/Assembly
hearing was like.

It started over two hours late.  The ██████ was busy congratulating one
of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to
heap on the glory.  That said, the show began with ███ ██████████er Bill
█████.  Mr. █████ has one story, and regardless how well ██ tells it,
and ██ does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.
One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a
single-mom, call ███ Lady-Bird █████, who travels across an angry land
with ███ precocious pre-teen child, ████████████████.  They are
searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace
of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal
returns on investment.

Being the first speaker, Mr. █████ took at least half the heat (storm)
of ███████.  The rage of the Energy ██████ was palpable.  █████████, ███
Diegans shed 350 MW of load █████████ to save the entire system, and did
not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... ██
said it).  ██ is sick of hearing about demand management as being a
solution for the problem over ███████████████████, and ██ is about done
listening.  People in █████████ are depressed by the sudden price
hikes.  █████!

█████ did mention that ██████████████ reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but
in neighboring ███████, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. █████
correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a ██████████
problem, it is a regional problem.  One member of █████████████ asked
what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and
construction process?

█████ referred to Governor ██████████████ ███████████████ issued █████████
to which ███████ plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a
███████ permitting time line.  The ██████████ are enough if the
applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and
air offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take ██████████ before you get
to ███████.

The next panel included Mr. ████ of ███████, and Ms. █████.  I went too
hard on ███ █████████, calling ███ Let=0F's Do █████.  That was a 0.8 ███.
Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy ██████
instructed Ms. █████ to use ███ authority to order SDG&E to divert the
pass through of funds from the customers to the ██ until the dysfunction
of the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms █████ promised
to review this option at ███ █████████████ Meeting where ███ will enact
SDG&E rate caps (told you).

The star of ███████, I thought, was ████ General Counsel ██████████.
Mr. █████ comes to ██████████.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. █████ came in
place of Mr. ███████, thank the Lord.  Mr. █████ put into ████-eese what
these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for ████ to declare the
wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give
back the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. █████
answered as only a ████ attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It
takes time.  You must have evidence.  ████ uses a three-part criteria
for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  █████'s
based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high
prices.  You would have to sue ████ in federal court, and the best you
could hope for is for ████ to reconsider its decision upon remand from
███████████████████████.

Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were
stumped.  ████ (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. █████ of ████,
█████ use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that
generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and
retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?
Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. █████ played back and forth the familiar
strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and
forth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in
the past I hated the process at ████.  Today, I have a renewed respect
for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a
mob.

For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be
undertaken by ███████.

 @@@ ███ Issues ███ on ████████████████████████ ████et

Well, the official title is, =0F"Order █████████████████████████ into the
Functioning of █████████████████████████████████ █████████████████ on
Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of █████████ Gas &
Electric Company=0F".  I like my title better.

This Order, or ███ was issued at the last business meeting of ██████████████, on ████████.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale
markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in
█████████ on █████████ at █████████████ Convention Center.

Here are the questions ███████ wishes us to address:

=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=
nd
small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the
functioning of the wholesale market?)

=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or
other supply procurement activities? How should ██████████████ assess
reasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers
on just and reasonable terms?

=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=
nt
customers?

=0F=07 How should ██████████████, Attorney General, ███, ███ and ██
coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and
irregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?

=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve
practices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms ██████████████ can employ to make ratepayers whole?

There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a

person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and
everyone would die.

No one could decide who should go so finally █████████ gave a really
touching speech saying how ███ would give up ███ life to save the
others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands
and children and giving in to men.
