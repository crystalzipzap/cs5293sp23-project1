    By █████████████████Of ███████████████████████████████ (Dow Jones)--Hot weather and a still-robust economy have
intensified
 electricity demand in the face of drum-tight power supplies in ██████████,
the nation's
 most populous - and, in economic terms, most important - state.

 The resultant rolling "brown outs" and the potential for blackouts in the
future could have
 a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production in
██████████ and even in
 the national statistics. Indeed, the impact is likely to be greatest in the
highest
 value-added sectors: computers and computer components, two industries that
have
 been a key engine of ████ growth.

 Not only that, electricity generation is an important proxy in █████████████████████
 estimation of industrial production. So, the measurement of statistics
could be directly
 affected.

 About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial production
index is
 compiled on the basis of actual output volumes - tons of steel, boardfeet
of lumber, or
 millions of autos assembled, etc. For other forms of output, accounting for
about a
 quarter of the index, contributions to total production are estimated based
on hours
 worked data, with the implicit assumption that productivity - or the rate
of real output per
 labor hour - doesn't change much over short periods of time in these
industries. But the
 remainder of the index, about 26% according to a ███ economist, is
estimated using
 electricity generation measures.

 For this purpose, electricity generation is itself estimated from measures
of electric
 power usage by industry. Here, as with productivity, the technical
coefficient, or the
 amount of electricity input per unit of output, is assumed to be constant
over relatively
 long periods.


         As Usual, Things Are Different In ██████████


 ██████████ power companies, as part of the deregulation of the electric
power industry,
 offer their business customers "interruptible rate plans". That means that
for a
 discounted rate, customers "voluntarily" allow the power company to
interrupt their
 power supply in times of peak demand.

 Too bad.

 The heat of ██████ combined with continuing strong economic activity has,
in fact,
 resulted in widespread interruptions throughout ██████████.

 And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both a
statistical and real
 impact on production: the █████████████ earthquake of ████████████.

 That quake disrupted electricity generation, particularly south of the city
in ███████████████. Largely as a result of that disruption, national industrial
production declined by
 0.5% (0.6% in manufacturing) in ████████████.

 The computer and semiconductor chip producers in ██████████████ and
elsewhere in the
 state are very heavy users of electricity. It is reasonable to expect that
their total
 consumption of electricity, and their output, have skyrocketed since ████.

 This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy.


 First, chips are essential inputs to the production of other industries
from "smart chips"
 in cars to central processing units for computers. Thus, a bottleneck in
chip supplies
 because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyond
██████████.

 Second, chip production is among the highest value-added activities in ████████████████████████ stage of production adds significantly to the value of total
output. This
 means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatly
magnified
 effect on overall economic activity.

 The usage is not confined to chip production, however. An extensive range
of other
 ██████████-based industries - from chemicals to textiles - have intensive
electricity usage
 in their production.

 Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction in
electricity. And in
 fact, real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input.

 Ironically, these interruptions could complement the ███'s efforts to slow
economic
 activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases. What
infuriates
 ██████████ns might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us.
