██████████ (███████████████ that gasoline prices are finally settling down,
economists say another energy component could prove to be a spoiler on the
government's main consumer inflation gauge.
Amid a shifting regulatory landscape and typical ██████████ price increases,
the nation's utilities appear to be boosting consumers' electricity bills
enough to skew ██████████████████████ ████ consumer price index. Those gains
would partly offset the anticipated favorable influence of recently
declining gas prices.
"There is a real chance of starling increases in electricity prices over the
██████████ or two, thanks mostly to the bungled deregulation of the
industry," Ian ██████████, chief ████ economist at ████████████████████████
in ████████, ████, wrote in a recent report. "All the anecdotal evidence
from ████████ and East Costs suggests consumers are reeling from sudden
double - and in some cases triple - digit percentage increases in their
bills."
███████████ economist ███████████ agreed: "It is a potential trouble spot,
it is a particular problem in ████████." In ██████████, where no new power
plants have been built in ████████, the private companies that purchased
plants from the state's utilities have been raising prices in response to
strong demand and dwindling supply.
The impact of the cost increases will be revealed █████████, when █████████
Department releases ████████ ███ next █████████.
Economists generally expect the figures to point to a continued tame
inflation scenario - a 0.1% overall ███████ increase, featuring declining
clothing, computer and gas prices is forecast. █████ Department economist
███████████████ said recent statistics suggest gas prices fell 3% to 3.5%
██████████. That would mark a departure from ████, when soaring prices at
the nation's gas stations contributed to a big 0.6% spike in ███████.
Rising Demand, Surging Prices
But electricity, which represents 2.5% of the entire index, will be a wild
card in the coming report.
Electricity costs usually rise in ██████████ as consumers pay more for the
juice that powers their air conditioners. ███████████ is no different,
██████ said, adding that utilities have even more pricing power than normal.

"Overall demand for electricity has been rising. All this high-tech
equipment uses a lot of electricity," ██████ said.
Indeed, prices rose 0.8% in ████ after seasonal adjustments. Before those
adjustments, prices surged a whopping 6.6% during █████████.
As for a ████ increase, ███████ said "it certainly is a possibility. The
question is how are the seasonal factors are going to handle it."
██████████, however, believes it's clear that electricity costs are on the
rise. "Three factors are driving prices higher," ██ said. "First, flaws in
the auction system set up after deregulation effectively allow the
generating companies to manipulate prices at times of high demand. Second,
the economic boom means that periods of high demand are much more common
than was anticipated at the time of deregulation, so generators have more
opportunity to extract premium prices from distributors and, hence,
consumers. Third, little new electricity-generating capacity has been added
in ████████████."
Producer prices, which ██████████ says provide a good guide to movements in
███████, may offer ominous insight into the potential consumer electricity
price gains. Residential electric power prices on the producer level rose
faster in ████ than at any point since ████████████.
And they aren't expected to slow down anytime soon. ██████ could be
especially problematic because higher electricity costs will coincide with
another pickup in gas prices and continued gains in natural gas prices,
██████ said.
"We have no idea how far ███████ measure of residential electricity prices
could rise, but there must be a good chance that substantial increases will
be recorded," ██████████ said. "With natural gas prices also climbing again,
following a dip in ████, it may take a while before energy ceases to push
inflation higher."
