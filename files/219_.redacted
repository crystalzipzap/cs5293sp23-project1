  Market Participants:
  The █████ has posted its draft ████████████████████████████
(███) recommendation on its web site at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> . This document
recommends changes to the █████'s current █████████████████████ process and
related features of its business practices and operations. This is a draft
document, albeit one that we believe reflects significant effort and thought
on the part of both the stakeholders who provided the initial input and the
interdisciplinary design team that drafted this document.
  This ███ recommendation represents an essential milestone in
the broader ████████████████████████████ Project.  The first stage involved
soliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,
alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluating
reform proposals. The second stage involved the █████'s crafting an
integrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideas
developed with and/or by ███████████s in stage one. This document contains
the █████'s draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believe
this recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the Congestion
Management Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the final
design. We are actively soliciting ███████████s' comments and critiques
concerning this recommendation over ████████████████ (stage three of the ███
project).
  Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,
the █████ will revise this ███ recommendation. The revised recommendation
will be presented to the █████ Governing Board for discussion and review
only on ████████ (no Board action requested). The ███ recommendation will
continue to be developed through ██████ and the final recommendation will be
submitted to the █████ Governing Board for approval at the █████████████ and
7th meeting.  The approved ███ recommendation will be prepared (in
conjunction with ███████████s) for the final ██████ filing to ████ in
████████ (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at the
███ ███████████ meetings on ███████ and 14.
  At the ███████ and 14 ███████████ meetings, the █████ will
present the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide the
opportunity for ███████████s to clarify their understanding of what is being
proposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional ███████████ meetings
to facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of the
recommendation. Additional meeting dates will be discussed on ███████ at the
meeting.
  We look forward to reviewing this proposal with you and
receiving your comments. The █████ welcomes any and all comments and
critiques of this recommendation. We appreciate your attention and efforts
in this endeavor to reform the █████████████████████ process.
