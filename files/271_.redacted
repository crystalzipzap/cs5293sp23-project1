 Mandatory Buy Requirement Ends For █████████

 ███████████ (█████████)--The ██████████ Public █████████ Commission
approved a controversial plan ████████ morning that
 will allow the state's three investor-owned utilities to buy power outside
██████████████████████████████ market structure.

 The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commissioners █████
█████, ████████████████ and █████████████ voted
 in favor of the draft order.

 The decision relieves the three investor-owned utilities, ██████████████unit ████████████████████████ (███), ███████████████████████ (███) and ████████████████████ unit ██████████████████████████
(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement that
 became effective in ██████████ when the state moved to a deregulated
competitive market. Originally the mandatory buy
 requirement was set to end in ████, when all three utilities recovered
their stranded costs.

 "This decision is not as earth shattering as it sounds," Commissioner
█████, one of the author's of the draft order, said at
 ████████'s meeting. "I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this will
result in lower prices patched through to bundled
 customers."

 Trading platforms █████████████████████████████ and ████████████████████████████████ can now compete directly with the
 CalPX, which currently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.
The utilities can buy power from other "qualified
 exchanges" through an advice letter process.

 █████████ Can Trade With Other Exchanges Now

 ██████████'s big three utilities can buy power outside the CalPX market
structure immediately, through an advice letter process,
 which means the utilities have to notify the commission of their intent to
trade power with qualified exchanges such as ███,
 █████ or █████████.

 The commission said the exchanges have to offer the same services as the
CalPX - forward, █████ and ███████ trading, and
 anonymity to prevent self dealing between the buy side and sell side - in
order to meet the criteria for a qualified exchange.

 Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.
████████████ would not meet the criteria for a
 qualified exchange, commissioners said.

 The advice letter only needs to be filed once and s merely a formality that
would not need to be approved by a majority of the
 commission.

 ████████████, ████ senior attorney for regulatory affairs, told █████████
Newswires that ███ company "will quickly start
 looking at other exchanges and see what's out there. We're going to start
the advice letter process."

 ████████████ and SDG&E said they will do the same.

 Ed ███████, chairman and founder of ███, said ████████'s controversial
three-to-two vote in favor of the draft order "creates a
 tremendous opportunity for ███."

 "It allows us to bring the benefits of ██████████████ technology to
██████████," ███████ said. "This is really about bringing
 e-commerce to the market."

 ██████████████████, however, disagreed, saying "selling into our market
doesn't cost anything and selling into the ███ market
 costs 20 cents per megawatt-hour."

 Commissioner said having other exchanges will not only result in lower
electricity prices, but it will allow the buyer and seller
 the chance to see prices before making the purchase.

 CalPX's block forward prices are not immediately published, Commissioner
█████ said.

 Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Officer ██████████████ said
"█████'s split vote by the ████ in favor of
 accelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is not
well-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive."
