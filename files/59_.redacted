+High Cost of Oil and ███ural Gas Puts ███ $518 Million Behind in █████████████████████

Faced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy ████████ demand
for electricity, █████████████████████████████ has filed preliminary
paperwork with █████████████████████████████████████ identifying $518
million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricity
in ████. ███ will file with the ██████████ in █████████ for permission to
recover the expense in customer bills beginning ████████████.

Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that is
currently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund is
pursuant to an agreement reached in ██████████ with ████████████████████████████████ and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between ███ and its
customers, as well as a 6% ██████ rate reduction for ███████████. As a
result of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residential
electric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.

The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since the
first quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in ████.
Since January ████, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. ███ural gas
prices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January ████. With the
onset of ██████, natural gas prices may increase further as demand for
heating fuel increases.
