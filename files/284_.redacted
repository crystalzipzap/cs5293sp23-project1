>    On █████████████████, the ███ issued a █████████████
> for the "███████████ Market Participating Load Trial Program" soliciting
> participation in the ███'s Ancillary Services and Supplemental Energy
> markets by additional Participating Loads.  The ███ proposed to
> accommodate such participation from ███████████████████████████ by Loads
> that could provide telemetry of their Demand data to the ███'s ██████████████████████████ pursuant to a "relaxed" Technical Standard.  The ███
> indicated that it would accept proposals for up to the following amounts
> of capacity for bidding in the specified markets:
>
>      ████████ning Reserve:   400 ██
>      Replacement Reserve:   400 ██
>      Supplemental Energy: 1,000 ██
>
>    In response to that solicitation, the ███ received
> several proposals and has been working to implement participation by the
> respondents.  In the course of the implementation process, the ███ has
> determined that the actual amounts of capacity that will potentially be
> available to participate will be below the maximum for any of the listed
> services.  Approximately half of the 400 ██ in ████████ and Replacement
> has been committed (some subject to ████ approval) leaving approximately
> 200 ██ available in each category.  Approximately 750 ██ is still
> available in the Supplemental Energy category.
>
>    Therefore, the ███ wishes to announce a re-opening
> of the period for submittal of proposals for the "███████████ Market
> Participating Load Trial Program"  The ███ seeks to obtain the total
> amount of participation requested for the trial program within the time
> available.  At this time the ███ plans to leave this solicitation open
> until the maximum capacities are reached as noted above.  Also it should
> be noted that while the solicitation will be open until the requested
> capacities are reached,  the current timeframe of the ███████████ Trial
> Program and the applicability of the "relaxed" Technical Standards runs
> only through ████████████████.  At this time the ███ expects to continue
> this Load Program beyond ████████████████, however a final decision on
> continuation and the exact technical and commercial details applicable to
> any such continuation will be reached ██████████████ based on a review of
> the ███████████ Program experience.
>
>
>    Additional respondents should follow the process and
> requirements set forth in the █████████████████ █████████████ in all
> respects other than the date for delivery of proposals.  This can be
> located on the ███ Home Page at  http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/load/ .
> or by navigating from ████████████████████████████████████████ to
> Participating Loads.  There are 4 documents listed under the ██████
> posting entitled " Formal Invitation for the ███████████ Load
> Participation in the ███ Ancillary  Service and Supplemental Energy
> Markets. "
