Recently, there have been several questions regarding █████'s fitness club 
reimbursement policy.  I want to take this opportunity to advise you of the 
revised policy as well as make you aware of a corporate membership rate which 
has been established with ████████████████████████████.

█████ will reimburse the following fees for membership at any fitness 
facility:

up to a maximum of $100 for membership fees
up to $25 per month for dues

A corporate membership with ████████████████████████ has been established for 
anyone interested in joining.  If you would like to try out the facility 
prior to joining, ██████████ is offering a █████ guest pass.  Please speak 
with ████████████████ regarding the pass or to enroll.  

The fees are as follows:

Individual   Couple/Family
$200 membership  $300 membership
$████████ for dues  $█████████ for dues

When you enroll, please specify that you work for  █████ █████████████.  
██████████ will bill █████ directly for your ███████ dues and we will submit 
to have your dues reimbursed through payroll deduction each pay period.  

If you have any questions regarding the fitness club reimbursement policy, 
please do not hesitate to ask either me or █████████████.

Kind regards -
Amy
