█████████████, I made the first attached presentation to ████████ Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on ████████'s investigation of the wholesale 
market in ████████ (and in particular ██████████).  ██████████ (of ██████ 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by ██████████ and ████████████.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much ████ can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged ████ from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in ██████████████ and the rest of ████████ 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if ██████████████ does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ███ real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The ██████████ should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in ██████████.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (████████████), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that ███ sent to 
████████████ on ██████.  ███'s version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On ██████, ███ talked to █████ 
and answered some additional questions.  ███ said that █████ is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory ██ buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from █████ Online.  ██ also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .
