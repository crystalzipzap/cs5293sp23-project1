████ has been working with █████ and others and the ███ to develop a model 
that works for CA as well as for ████████████████████ (which the ███ would 
then operate).  I think this summary explains the kinds of things were trying 
to get in congestion management reform.  I'll send a few other things to look 
at.

████:

Per our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be 
the key attributes of a "reformed" zonal congestion model.  The document does 
not fully address all of the issues discussed at ███████████████ congestion 
reform meeting in ██████████, but I believe that (other than for some 
details) it is consistent with what both the ███ and many of the market 
participants are proposing.

This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who 
haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be 
too far off.  

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I 
offered at ███████████████ meeting and also to support my view that, if the 
███ were to implement the ████/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process 
rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference 
between what I've been advocating in the █████████ and the CA███'s model.  
(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the "██████████" 
process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way 
scheduling is done - i.e., the ███ would not act as the ██'s representative 
in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal 
counterflows since ███████ would do this themselves.)  So there is a real 
possibility that, with some agreement on the ███'s longer-term plans (whether 
integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will 
rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the 
models for the region.

[Sue, Curt, ███, ████, ████, ████, ██████, ████ and Barney: I'd appreciate 
any feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to 
████@tca-us.com, NOT the █████ address from which this e-mail was sent.
