█████ Broadband Services is the latest addition to █████████ SAP rollout.  
The ██████ and ██████ project team and █████'s business units are currently 
preparing for the project's final implementation.  ██████ and ██████ is an 
█████ initiative tasked with laying a common financial, human resources, 
project management, and procurement foundation throughout the majority of 
█████'s businesses.

███ "Go-Live"

On █████████, █████ Broadband Services supplemented their current SAP 
functionality with HR Online and SAP HR, including payroll and organizational 
structure management.  HR Online enables the ███ population to enter their 
own time, view and update their personal information, and view their vacation 
time and individual payroll information via █████'s intranet.

Additionally, this implementation enhanced ██████████████████ Project and 
Procurement processes that ███ has had in operation since █████████████.  
These enhancements included an ███ pilot of B2B, a web-based requisitioning 
tool. Among the benefits of these enhancements will be improved information 
flow across business units currently on SAP.

██████ "Go-Live"

This final ██████ and ██████ implementation will directly impact more than 
15,000 █████ employees and contractors -- odds are that you are one of them!  
People impacted on ██████st include:

all █████ employees paid out of █████████████████ in ███████, excluding 
██████ employees
the financial communities of █████ Energy Services, █████ Investment 
Partners, █████ North America, █████ Renewable Energy Corporation, Gas 
██████████████, ██████████████, and ███████████████.
the project management communities of █████ North America, ███████████████████, ███████████████████████, ██████████████, and ███████████████.
the human resources communities of █████████, ██████████, █████ Energy 
Services, █████ Engineering and Construction Company, █████ Investment 
Partners, █████ North America, █████ Renewable Energy Corporation (███████ 
only), the international regions, Gas ██████████████, ██████████████, and 
███████████████.

General SAP training will be available in ██████████ via █████████ intranet.  
Additional, specific, SAP classes and workshops are scheduled to begin in ███ 
and continue through ██████.  Information on the project can be obtained 
through █████████ intranet at http://sap.enron.com and by contacting ██████████████ representatives currently working with the project.  A list of ██████████████ representatives is located on the intranet site.

Additional information related to ██████████st implementation will be 
communicated to you over ███████████████████.

Thank you.
