News Brief:
+███ ██████ puts gas assets up for sale
███████████ Gas Daily ██████ reports that ███ ██████ is putting its █████
Sea gas assets up for sale. The utility confirmed █████ that is in
"preliminary talks" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was
"very ██████████". The move follows "a number of unsolicited expressions of
interests" in the business, including its operatorship. ███ said it is
reviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell at
its conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review.

A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: "The business
has changed a lot in █████████████." ███ has already put up its ██
generation assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets could
mark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analysts
believe that assets no longer give "competitive advantage" to energy
companies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gas
and electricity.

███'s principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2%
of the 83bn ft? Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft? ██████████
█████ field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft? ███████ field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft?
Schooner field. It also has a number of upstream exploration licences and
interests in pipelines.
