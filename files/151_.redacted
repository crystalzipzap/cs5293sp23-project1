THE ███████████████████ / ██████████ 

Critics Seek
More ███████
Over ███

Some people want ██████████████████████████████████████████ to be a lot less 
independent. 
The ██████-based nonprofit corporation, which acts as the traffic cop for the 
state's electricity grid, has been a lightning rod for criticism during ████████████'s power crisis. Though generally praised for keeping lights on in the 
face of severe shortages of electricity, the ███ has come under fire for 
failing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will pay 
generators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts. 
Pressure on the ███ has eased considerably since █████████, when its 
governing board voted to lower the cap on such ████████, emergency purchases 
-- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 a 
megawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn't been turned off completely. Some 
lawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ███ board, which 
includes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, and 
commercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want to 
streamline the board and make it more accountable to the state's elected 
officials. 
The ███ was created by the state's ████ utility-deregulation act to transmit 
electricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised the 
independent board as a way to give the various "stakeholders" -- generators, 
utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energy 
is supplied. Members serve for █████████████████. 
"It's inappropriate for the ███ governing board to vote on issues that 
benefit them financially," says Sen. ███████████, a ████████ Democrat. ███ 
questions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers to 
sit on the ███ board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they have 
an interest in keeping those prices high. 
Sen. ██████ spent much of the ███████████'s recent ██████ recess fielding 
complaints about high electricity costs from ███ constituents, customers of 
████████████████████████████, a unit of █████████-based █████████████. ████████████, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to have 
price regulations fully lifted. This ██████, its rates have doubled, as high 
temperatures and power shortages have swept the ████. 
In response to a series of price spikes in ███████████████████ and the wider 
contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, 
state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing ████████ in ██████████. High 
on the agenda: possible changes in the ███'s governing structure and scrutiny 
of the way it handles power statewide on ████████. Critics say emergency 
purchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as high 
as 33% of the market on ████████ earlier this ██████. 
Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. ███████████, an ████████ Democrat 
who was the architect of the ████ deregulation law -- would like to make the 
███ more accountable to state elected officials. 
Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflicts 
from sitting on the ███ board, as well as abolishing the ███ entirely and 
shifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervision 
of █████████████████████████████████████. Until ████, the ███ regulated all 
electric utility rates and services. 
███ board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger over 
the price spikes on the ███, which has only a limited ability to set prices. 
Most electricity isn't sold through the ████████, emergency market -- but 
through long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or ██████████████ 
in advance through █████████████████████████████, which is a nonprofit 
corporation established by the ████ law to serve as a trading floor. 
"We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressure 
from one state senator or anyone else," to keep prices artificially low, says 
███ Chairman █████████████████, who represents █████████████████████████████████████████████, the trade group for non-utility power generators. ██ 
dismisses criticism of the board's out-of-state members. There needs to be 
"an independent, interstate board" because energy is transmitted across state 
lines, ██ says. Two ███████-based power sellers on the board, ████████████ 
and ███████████, deny any conflict. ████████████, ██████'s chairman and chief 
executive, blames state officials for expanding the ███'s role to include 
monitoring prices. "If there's any finger-pointing," Mr. ██████ says, "they 
probably should start with the big finger pointed right at them." 
Substantial restructuring of ███ governance could prove difficult. The state, 
through the governor-appointed ███████████████████████████, has limited power 
to make changes. Past efforts by ███████████████████ to exert control didn't 
go far. 
█████████, state lawmakers tried to give ███████████████████ the power to 
confirm or reject ███ board members to make them accountable to state 
officials. (Nominees had previously gone on automatically.) The effort was 
opposed by officials of ████████████████████████████████████████ in 
██████████, ████, which argued that the state couldn't have veto power over 
the nominees of out-of-state power producers. In a compromise, ██████████ 
officials were given authority to veto half the board -- those nominated by 
residential, industrial, commercial and agricultural power-users. 
█████████████████████████████ has final regulatory authority over the ███ and 
has viewed state attempts to meddle with the agency as an unconstitutional 
attempt to hinder interstate commerce. 
Any proposed changes in ███'s governing structure "would be looked at very 
closely by ████," says ███ attorney ██████████████. 
This ██████, the ███ board displayed an independence that was annoying to 
state lawmakers. In ████, Sen. █████ called on the board to lower its price 
cap for emergency purchases, from $750 a megawatt hour (roughly the amount of 
electricity needed to power 1,000 homes) to $250. The board responded by 
lowering the cap to $500 a megawatt hour. A second attempt to lower the cap 
to $250 failed to get a majority vote. 
The reason? The three private power-seller representatives, including the 
████████████████████████████████████████, were joined by those representing 
agricultural, industrial and commercial users in opposing a lowering of the 
cap. 
Then, the pressure on the ███ board really intensified. Gov. ██████████ 
weighed in, by sending the ███ board a letter asking it to lower the cap "to 
the lowest possible level." ██████ Secretary ███████████████ ordered the 
representative of federal-public-power sellers to change ███ vote from no to 
yes. A consumer representative from ██████████████████████████ also moved to 
the "aye" column, allowing the cap to be lowered to $250. 
Lowering the cap removes some of the rate pressure on residential and 
commercial consumers in █████████ -- and takes some of the heat off the ███ 
board. But not entirely: A ███████████████████████████ report on the state's 
electricity market that was sent to the governor after the vote said that the 
members of the ███ and ██████████████████ boards "can have serious conflicts 
of interest" and that both organization aren't "accountable to the state or 
its consumers." 
An ███ spokesman said the board is in the process of producing a formal 
response to the report and it declined to comment. A spokesman for ███████████████████ said that it has followed the law regarding conflicts and that it 
does protect consumers.
