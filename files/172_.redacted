████████████ summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ███ on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- ████ reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ███ purchases.  ANd if the ███ want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with ████, wait ███████ and amend its contract

Subject: ████ Order on ████████████████████████ Against ███


We have good news on the ███ price caps front.  The ████ has made it
clear that ███ does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
███ at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On ██████, the ████ issued its ██████████████████ in connection with the ████ 
10 complaint filed by █████████████████████████████████ ("██").  As you may 
recall, ██ requested ████ to issue a stay of the ███'s maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ███ to reverse any price cap reductions.  ██ 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
████ on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, █████████████, ████ issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ███'s price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ███ "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ███, but a cap on what the ███ 
was willing to pay."  The ██████████ said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the ██████████████████████████ or bilateral markets."

████ notes in ██████'s Order that the 6/28 the ███'s Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ███ further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 ██."

The ██ complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  ██ also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ███'s justification for the 
price cap reduction.

████ denied the ██ stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The ██████████ reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ███ has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ███, the ███ cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, ████ also states that, "███ has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ███ is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  ████ then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("███") calls and that ███ calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ███'s resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ███ markets when system load exceeds 38,000 ██, ████ 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our ███████████████████ and the ███ tariff."  [Emphasis added]

████ goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ███ in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ███'s market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
███'s tariff.  This would require ███████' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to ██████████ approval.  As stated above, our ██████████████████ was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

███ is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ███ markets."

Concurrences were filed by ██████████ers ██████ and ██████.  ██████ suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in ██████████.  ██████ says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "█████, the 
██████████ at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  ██ then reiterates ███ preference for 
removing all price caps.  ██ also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ███ as operator of the ██████████ grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  ██ refers approvingly to the ███████ resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  ██████ states that, "The independence of 
the ███'s governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  ██████ advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the ██████████ markets."

This decision makes it clear that ███ cannot lower the caps at ████████'s 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ███.

Please call if you have any questions.

███
