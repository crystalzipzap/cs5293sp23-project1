=███████████████████: `We Welcome Probe Into Power ████et'  (This article
was originally published ███████)       By █████████████     OF █████████
NEWSWIRES    ███████████ (Dow Jones)--When ██████████ Attorney General ████
███████ completes ███ investigation into possible "collusion" in the
wholesale electricity market by generators, energy companies say ██ will
probably find the same thing ██████████████ found in ███████████ safe:
nothing.  Still, those companies that own generation in the state say they
welcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General ████ ███████.
"We have done nothing wrong at all," said ████████████, spokesman for █████████████████████████ (███). "Our plants have been running ██████████ long.
Prices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in new
generation and then try and rig the market."  For ███████████████████,
utilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations
that generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for
the price spikes.  ██████'s office said an investigation is still pending.
State regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findings
of which will be submitted to the governor and ████████████████████████████████████████ by ███████████████████.  Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  There
isn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said ███████████████████,
director of the University of ██████████, Berkley's, ████████████████.
"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price for
power," ██████████ said. "Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in the
commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  "I
would say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge high
prices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. There
is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... ."
The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. ██████████, ██ said, is as a
consequence of █████████ consumers being the first in the nation to pay
market-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid by
utility █████████ Gas & Electric, a unit of █████████████ (███), were passed
on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.
█████ ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own
investigation as well.  ██████ (DYN) President ███████████████ also says
that an investigation "will turn up nothing."  So why conduct one?  "This is
a very politically charged issue," █████████ said. "When something goes
wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at."  A source in the
governor's office said █████ is aware that Attorney General ███████'s
investigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. █████ "has a responsibility to
███ constituents."  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn up
is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough
power plants being built to meet increasing demand, said ████████████,
chairman and chief executive officer of the ██████████ Independent System
Operator.  ██████ said ██ doesn't believe that there is anything wrong with
the way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market works
well.  "Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)
knowing that you're 1,000 ██ short? I have trouble identifying that as
market power abuse," ██████ said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,
such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&E
customers, ███████████, ██████, ████████████ (SO) and ███████ (RLI) all
still plan to invest in generation in the state.  That's a different stance
than the companies took ███████████ when the ███ reduced the wholesale price
cap in the real-time market to $250/██h.  "At ██████████████████ the market
is short power and you got to get people to build new generation," said
██████'s █████████. "We got a big investment in ██████████. We're not
walking away from that."  -By █████████████, ███████████████████;

Complaint
(This article was originally published ███████)
██████████ (Dow Jones)--██████████'s power grid administrator ██████ urged
federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking
compensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailed
during an extreme power grid emergency.
The independent system operator told ████████████████████████████████████████ that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a
"situation that never has occurred any time since the ███ began operations,
and if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely."
The ███ noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid already
allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried the
power producers' complaint as "a collateral attack" on a previous ████ order
rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.
Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort
measure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ███ said.
The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of
interruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ███ said.
The ███'s objections were echoed by the state's electricity distribution
utilities and ██████████ regulators.
They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from
under the price controls the ███ has imposed in an effort to rein in
skyrocketing power prices ███████████.
The generators "knew when they purchased ██████████ power plants and when
they entered into their export contracts that the ███ could alter their
schedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it even
more expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ███ to maintain grid
reliability in ██████████ is irresponsible," said Southern ██████████
██████, a unit of ██████ International (EIX).
"The complaint is a sham," declared the ██████████ Public Utilities
Commission.
"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ███ price caps by
making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, and
sell the power back to the ███ at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'
market power," the ███ said, calling for ████ to summarily reject the
complaint.
"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains of
conduct consistent with the ███'s authority under pertinent ████ decisions,
and seeks to avoid the price cap," the ███ said.
But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the
complaint, filed ██████ by ███████ Power Generation Inc. (███), ██████ Power
████eting Inc. (DYN) and ███████████████ ██████████ (SO).
"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price
of $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ███
would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market
participants who schedule energy for export," said █████████████████████████████████████, ████████████████████████ representing competitive power
producers.
"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that the
curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ███ will be compensated,"
said █████████████████████████████████
"Now that the ███ Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,
it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur
more frequently. Less energy will be imported into ██████████ and more
energy will leave ██████████ in search of higher prices," said Williams
Energy ████eting & Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actual
damages and lost opportunity costs.
At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position as
well.
"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ███ must divert the
transactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the full
costs of doing so," said the Northern ██████████ Power Agency.
