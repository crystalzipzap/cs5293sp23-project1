Attached is a Draft Decision approving SDG&E's Emergency Motion for authori=
ty=20
to enter into bilateral contracts.

The decision directs to enter into bilateral agreements that will expire by=
=20
12/02.  It provides similar reasonableness guidance as provided to ███=20
(bilateral contracts must be within 5% of actual ██████ procurement ████████
 =20

The draft decision rejects SDG&E's request to allocate those contracts ███
=20
residential and small commercial customers.  It rejects SDG&E's request ████
=20
an exemption from the affiliate rules, which would have allowed SDG&E ███20
enter into bilateral agreements with its trading affiliate without posting=
=20
those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process.

Because this decision adopts the same principles in the ███ and ████=20
Decisions, I give a low probability to changing the decision language. =20
However, if folks would still like us to weigh in on an issue, please let m=

know asap.  Thanks.

Subject: Draft Decision Issued in SDG&E Emergency Motion



███ █████ has issued the attached draft decision with regard to the ██████ =
=20
███████, emergency motion filed by SDG&E to enter into bilateral power =20
contracts.? SDG&E sought similar authority to that granted to ██████  and=
=20
████ in ███████████.? The draft decision would grant the motion,  but would=
=20
impose certain conditions different from those requested by the  utility.?=
=20
The differences are summarized below:
?
Background
Under the terms of the  Commissi███01,s D.00-08-021, SDG&E is currently=20
authorized to participate  in the ██ forward markets for energy services,=
=20
subject to seasonal trading  limits, through the end of the last utility ra=
t████
freeze.? SDG&E is not  proposing an increase to the limits approved in=20
D.00-08-021 and will treat its  capacity purchases under those limits,=20
although it reserves the right to request  expanded authority in the future=
.?=20
The draft decision also notes that  SDG&E proposes that costs associated=20
with, and gains/losses from these  bilateral contracts should be attributed=
=20
only to small commercial and  residential customers.? It also notes that=20
intervenors focused on four  general areas of concern regarding the ████████
c=20
authority requested by  SDG&E: duration of contracts, reasonableness=20
standards, request for  exemption from affiliate rules, and ratemaking.
?
Duration of  Contracts
SDG&E requested  authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire ███
=20
or before ██████████████████.? The ███ notes that the ██████████ recently=
=20
instituted an  investigation into the impact of the functioning of ██████
wholesale electric  market on retail rates in SDG&E=01,s service territory =
and=20
that the ███  will consider whether SDG&E should be removed from that defau=
lt=20
provider  role.? The ███ states that, "the ██████████ should not compromise=
 =20
future long-term solutions by affording SDG&E greater purchasing authority =
=20
than is needed to address the current emergency situation.? For this  reas██
█████
we ██████████████████████████ to what we described in ███████████  as ██████
████████bilateral contracting authority, that is, contracts with delivery  occurrin=
████
on or before █████████████████."
?
Reasonableness  Standards
The draft decision  suggests that the ███ provides a forum to establish a=
=20
common framework for all  three utilities for determining ██████████████████
s=20
of their bilateral  purchases.? However, in the interim, it adopts the same=
=20
reasonableness  standard for near-term contracts as it did for ███.? "If th=
████
average  price of SDG&E=01,s bilateral transactions, delivered or requiring=
 =20
delivery, over the course of an ██████ period exceeds the average price of =
=20
SDG&E=01,s corresponding portfolio of transactions, delivered or  requiring=
=20
deliver over ███████████████, by more than 5%, then the ██████████  will=20
initiate a reasonableness review.? Reasonableness reviews, to the  extent=
=20
needed, will take place as part of ████████████████████████████  Cost=20
Proceeding."
?
Affiliate Rules  Exemption
SDG&E's request to be  exempted from the affiliate rules for any ██████████
=20
from affiliates was  denied.
?
Ratemaking
TURN  urged the ██████████ to reject SDG&E=01,s request to limit the rate███
king =20
impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial =
=20
customers, saying that, "the potential risks and benefits should be spread =
=20
among all customers."? The draft decision states that, "we do not  believe =
it=20
prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to  residenti=
al=20
and small commercial customers.? This aspect of  SDG&E=01,s motion is denie=
d."
?
Transparency  Considerations
The ███ orders SDG&E  to disclose all bilateral transactions to the ███████
=20
Division on a confidential  basis in a ███████ report.? The draft decisi███
=20
notes that, "WPTF and  ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral=
=20
transactions is required,  compared to that proposed by ██████? We adopt=20
consistent disclosure  standards for SDG&E bilateral contracts as that=20
adopted in ███████████ for  ████ and ███.? This issue may be revisited on a=
=20
going forward basis in  I.00-08-002."
?
Response Time
The normal response time  has been shortened.? Parties to the proceeding ███
y=20
file comments on the  draft decision no later than noon on ███████████████
████.? I suggest that  comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of ██████
decision, but strongly  advocating that SDG&E be required to publicly post=
=20
its transactions, as it  agreed to do in Advice Letter 1234-E, with regard =
███20
SDG&E's participation  in ████████████████████████.? In addition, we should=
=20
consider whether to  refight the issue of limiting the ratemaking impacts ██
f=20
the bilateral contracts  to SDG&E's residential and small commercial=20
customers.
